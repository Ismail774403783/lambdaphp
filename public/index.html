<h1><a href="https://github.com/san-kumar/lambdaphp"></a>LambdaPHP v0.01</h1>
<p>Quick and Dirty PHP website hosting using Aws Lambda (i.e. pay by requests instead of paying a fixed monthly hosting
    fees).
</p>
<p>Remember the good old days when you used to FTP your PHP files, static HTML files, css files to a server - now you
    can do that using AWS Lambda!
</p>
<p>Any files you put inside the <code>public</code> directory will be accessible as if they were hosted on an Apache
    server with <code>mod_php</code>. Difference is you don’t have to pay any monthly hosting fees because they’re
    running on AWS Lambda which means you are billed only by the number of requests. This includes 1 million free
    requests per month and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month (<a
            href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/">details here</a>).
</p>
<h2><a id="Installation_12"></a>Installation</h2>
<p>Installation is simple. All you need is PHP 7+ with <a href="https://getcomposer.org"><code>composer</code></a></p>
<p>To install, just type this on your command line (terminal)</p>
<pre><code>composer create-project lambdaphp/lambdaphp &lt;project-name&gt; </code></pre>
<p>This should create a <em>project-name</em> directory inside which there is a <code>public</code> directory. Any
    files, including any PHP files you put in the <code>public</code> directory can be accessed directly from your web
    browser.
</p>
<p>Once your are done putting files in the <code>public</code> folder, just type this on your command line to deploy
    your site using AWS Lambda:
</p>
<pre><code>lambdaphp deploy </code></pre>
<p><em>You may need to enter your AWS credentials as <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html">described here</a> (same
    as aws-cli)</em>.
</p>
<p>If everything goes as expected, you should see this message:</p>
<pre><code>Website deployed! To access your site visit: https://XXXX.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/web/&lt;any-file-in-public-folder&gt;&lt;.php|css|js|etc&gt; </code></pre>
<p><em>(If you get a “command not found” error, make sure you have <code>.\vendor\bin</code> in your PATH)</em></p>
<p>That’s it! LambdaPHP will give you the URL using which you can access your site just like any other site hosted on
    Apache. It is possible to use your own custom domains with https too (see below).

<h2><a id="Features_41"></a>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Host static (.css, .js, .png, etc) and dynamic files (.php)</li>
    <li>Most PHP functionality, GET, POST requests, etc work seamlessly.</li>
    <li>File operations incl <code>file_get_contents</code>, <code>file_put_contents</code>, etc works seamlessly with
        AWS S3 (via stream wrapping)
    </li>
    <li><code>Sessions</code> and user authentication works right out of the box! (via DynamoDB session wrapper)</li>

<h2><a id="FAQ_68"></a>FAQ</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Which PHP version will my site be running?</p>
        <p>Currently it supports PHP 7.2.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Is it really free to host my site this way?</p>
        <p>Yes you get 1 million free requests per month and and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month. Currently
            lambdaphp runs very fast with 128MB RAM and has an average response time is 400ms. So using the <a
                    href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/lambda-tools/pricing-calculator.html">pricing calculator here</a>,
            you can process about 1,000,000 (1M) requests per month free of cost. YMMV. Also remember every assets on
            your page creates a new request, so factor that in and bundle them together using Webpack.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>My site is loading slowly?</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.phase2technology.com/blog/bundle-your-front-end-with-webpack">Use Webpack</a> to reduce
            the number of requests per page (bundle CSS, JS, Font files, etc into a single js file). This will also make
            sure to reduce the number of requests per load helping you stretch your 1M requests even more.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>My website gets lots of traffic… can this handle it?</p>
        <p>Theoretically speaking AWS Lambda scales very well so it should be able to handle a lot of traffic easily. It
            performs better with more traffic since that reduces the load time. But for anything above 20M requests /
            mo, you’ll be missing the point of this whole thing because you can get a dedicated instance for $10/mo
            anyway ;)
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>How do I add <code>X</code> PHP extension?</p>
        <p>I’ve currently compiled php using the most popular PHP extensions. If you need to a custom extension, just
            using the Dockerfile in Robert’s project below.
